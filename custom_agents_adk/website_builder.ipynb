      "That sounds like a wonderful project! A \"warm and cozy\" vibe is perfect for a coffee shop like **Bean & Brew**. Here is a comprehensive plan for your landing page:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Page Layout Plan\n",
      "Based on your requirements, here is the recommended structure for your landing page:\n",
      "*   **Navigation Bar:** A simple menu with your logo (Bean & Brew), and links to the Menu, About Us, and Contact sections.\n",
      "*   **Hero Section:** A large, inviting image of a steaming cup of coffee or the shop's interior, featuring a bold headline and a primary call-to-action (e.g., \"See Our Menu\").\n",
      "*   **\"About Our Beans\" Section:** A dedicated area to talk about your coffee sourcing, roasting process, and the \"cozy\" atmosphere you provide.\n",
      "*   **Featured Menu Preview:** A visually appealing grid showing off your top 3 signature drinks or pastries.\n",
      "*   **Contact & Location Section:** A section containing your address, store hours, phone number, and a simple contact form.\n",
      "*   **Footer:** Social media icons (Instagram, Facebook), copyright info, and a newsletter sign-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Suggested Color Palette\n",
      "To achieve that warm, cozy atmosphere, I recommend the following color scheme:\n",
      "*   **Deep Espresso (#3E2723):** Use this for primary headings and the footer.\n",
      "*   **Creamy Latte (#FFF8E1):** A soft background color that is easier on the eyes than pure white.\n",
      "*   **Roasted Cinnamon (#A1887F):** Great for secondary accents or buttons.\n",
      "*   **Sage Green (#81C784):** A subtle accent color to represent freshness and organic beans.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Suggested Content\n",
      "**Hero Section:**\n",
      "*   **Headline:** \"Your Daily Dose of Cozy.\"\n",
      "*   **Sub-headline:** \"At Bean & Brew, we craft more than just coffee; we create a space for you to slow down, sip, and stay awhile.\"\n",
      "*   **Button Text:** \"Find Your Favorite Brew\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Contact Info Section:**\n",
      "*   **Headline:** \"Visit Us in the Neighborhood\"\n",
      "*   **Body Text:** \"Whether you're looking for a quiet corner to work or a friendly place to catch up, our doors are open.\"\n",
      "*   **Details:**\n",
      "    *   **Address:** 123 Coffee Lane, Brewtown\n",
      "    *   **Hours:** Mon-Fri: 7am - 6pm | Sat-Sun: 8am - 5pm\n",

    "- **Docstrings matter** — the ADK uses them as tool descriptions. Be specific about what each parameter means.\n",

    "- **Test edge cases** — what happens when a user asks for a page type your tools don't handle?\n",

    "### Stretch Goals\n",
    "- Add a `suggest_images` tool that recommends stock photo descriptions for each section\n",
    "- Support different page types with different layouts (e.g. portfolio vs. blog)\n",
    "- Add a `generate_sitemap` tool that plans a multi-page website structure"
