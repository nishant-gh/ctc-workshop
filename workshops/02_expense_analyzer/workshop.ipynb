    "\n",
    "You've just built and observed an AI agent that turns messy invoices into a clean expense report. Here's what to take away:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool Design = Product Requirements\n",
    "The fields you put in your tool definitions (what parameters, what types, what descriptions) directly control what the AI can do. Adding a \"category\" field made the AI auto-categorize expenses. Removing `save_report` made the AI unable to produce output. **Your tools are your feature spec.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Prompt = Product Strategy\n",
    "The system prompt tells the AI what to do and in what order. Changing one sentence (\"only process invoices above Rs 5,000\") changed the agent's entire behavior. **Your prompt is your product strategy document.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Loop = Execution Engine\n",
    "The loop is simple: ask the AI what to do, do it, repeat. The AI decides the order. It adapts to what it finds. It stops when it's done. **The loop is the engine; the tools and prompt are the steering wheel.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Competitive Advantage\n",
    "The difference between a great AI product and a failed POC often comes down to:\n",
    "- **Well-designed tools** with clear descriptions and correct types\n",
    "- **Specific system prompts** that leave no ambiguity\n",
    "- **The right level of autonomy** — knowing when the AI should decide vs. when a human should\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your competitive advantage as a PM:** knowing HOW agents work so you can design BETTER products. You don't need to write the code — but you need to understand the levers."
